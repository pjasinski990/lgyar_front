# LGYAR

### Overview

This is the frontend my envelope-system-based budgeting app I wrote for a university course.
At the time of writing the app can be accessed at [link](https://lgyar-front.herokuapp.com).

### Usage
After registering and account and logging in you will see the dashboard. From there you can perform your budgeting-related activities.

Budgeting workflow is as follows: 
1. Create a budgeting period and, optionally, edit its time frame (using calendar icon).
2. Specify your income for the period.
3. The right column of the app contains currently added envelopes. Use add, remove, and edit buttons to adjust envelopes, and their money limits to your liking.
4. Log your transactions using the left column of the app.
5. When your budgeting time frame ends finalize the period by clicking the bottom button. This period is now archived and can be reactivated from the archive view.
6. New budgeting periods will automatically copy your previous envelope settings and income.
